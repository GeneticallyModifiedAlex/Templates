# Alex's Obsidian Templates
 
The following are templates created by #AlexEdwards. These are Templates that are used in Alex's various Obsidian Vaults. 
The templates hold no sensitive information or details regarding any client device that pulls or pushes to this repo. 
The only items that are existing here are the markdown templates that need to be standardised.

- Periodic notes
### Usage
For any periodic note (day, week, etc) you will need to save it a folder structure as such

	Calendar>
	Files>
	Notes>
	Periodic Notes >
					Daily Notes>
					Weekly Notes> 
					Quaterly Notes>
					Monthly Notes>
					Yearly notes>

This way the periodic notes can be tracked linearly.
The days map from one to the next.

Yesterday > Today > Tomorrow

And notes on areas or topics are saved separately in the files section.
Periodic notes are based on the period of time they relate to and thus state objective facts about that opinion or feeling the author has about that period.

-  What did you do (tasks)
- What did you Make (files created )
- What did you want to do (things you wanted to achieve during the period and may contrast with the items that did in fact occur during that period).
- How do you feel (any sections of reflection during any period greater than a week where simple task tracking becomes reductive)
